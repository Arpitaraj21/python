1) python is a dynamically typed interpreted langauge

2) comments in python is the lines which we write is ignored by the interpreter and
we write to make us as well as others about the code what we have written

#to comment a line in python press control + /

''' mutliline comments '''

3) variables
variable is a container to store values .
** variables is a reserved  memory location to store values
** variable names are case-sensitive
** case-sensitive ->  This means that the language treats
uppercase and lowercase characters differently.

example- arpita = 22
         Arpita = 23

         
Q) can you assign different values to a variable

Yes, in Python, we can assign different values to a variable
at different points in our program. Python variables are dynamic,
meaning they can change types and values throughout the execution
of the program.

a) integer
b) float
c) string
d) boolean
e) none



4) to check datatype we use
type(variable_name)
print(type(None))
o/p - <class 'NoneType'>


5)Typecasting
changing variable from one datatype to another datatype


6) Data structures in python

a) list -> A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable,
or changeable, ordered sequence of elements

b) tuples -> A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

c) sets -> Set is a data type in python used to store several items in a single variable
It is a collection that is written with curly brackets and is both unindexed and unordered.

d) dict -> Python's efficient key/value hash table structure is called a "dict". The contents
of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { },
e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }.
